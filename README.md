# PyTorch Implementation of TransformersLTE

We present 'Learning To Explain' (LTE) - a novel method for producing explanations by learning explanation masks. The LTE framework introduces an explainer-explainee model, in which the explainer learns to explain and justify the explainee's predictions. We demonstrate LTE's ability to produce explanations for ViT models, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on multiple explanations and segmentation tests.
